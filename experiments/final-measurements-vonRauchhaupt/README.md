# Measurements
This directory contains all data obtained in measurements, as part of this thesis.
Additionally, jupyter notebooks for creating the data visualization and graphics are included.


# Navigation
The directory `IPv4`, `IPv6` and `IPv4v6` contain all measurements using that specific IP stack.
Each contain seperate directories for the respective IPC type used.
Visualization of each experiment can be found here in the directory `results`

Since the 2nd reader experiments were only conducted using IPv4v6, there are no subdirectories except the `results` in `2ndReader`
