# Measurements
This directory contains all data obtained in measurements, as part of this thesis.
Additionally, a jupyter notebook for creating the data visualization and graphics is included.


# Navigation
The directory `IPv4`, `IPv6` and `IPv4v6` contain all measurements using that specific IP stack.
Each contain seperate directories for the respective IPC type used.
Visualization of each experiment can be found here in the directory `results`

Since the 2nd reader experiments were only conducted using IPv4v6, there are no subdirectories except the `results` in `2ndReader`

Furthermore, the file `overviewFinalMeasurements.xlsx` contains an overview of all measured aspects of each experiment.
Unique experiments were conducted twice to identify potential variance during measurements.
