\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, a new, shared memory based, \ac{IPC} architecture for the transmission of log messages was developed.
Additionally, the proof of concept \ac{IPS} Simplefail2ban was implemented and evaluated, in conjunction with the \ac{IPC} architecture.
Overall, the evaluation results are quite positive. Simplefail2ban largely performed as expected, blocking more than 95\% of all unwanted
traffic in all but two measurement scenarios. Compared to Fail2ban, significantly higher loads, both in terms of unwanted traffic 
rate a well as the number of clients, were achieved.
