    \caption[Simplefail2ban Architecture]{Activity diagram for the proof-of-concept IPS implementation. A variable number of ``banning threads'' receive log messages from a host and
    parse them with a predefined regular expressions. For messages that match the expression, the clients IP address is extracted from the log message and added to a hashtable, that keeps count of
    the number of matches per address. If the count reaches the configured limit, the address is added to the list of banned addresses with a current timestamp and inserted into the eBPF map. One ``unbanning
   thread'' routinely iterates through the banned list and checks, if a clients bantime hast elapsed. Clients with an elapsed bantime are removed from the eBPF map, banned list and hashtable.}
