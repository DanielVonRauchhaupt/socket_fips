\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Since the advent of the Internet, bandwiths available to both
commercial and private users have been ever increasing. While this opens up new possibilitys for high bandwiths
network applications, it also poses new security challenges for dealing with potentially malicious network traffic. In addition to traditional firewalls, 
Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (\ac{HIDS}) are a commonly used security measure, to protect a system  . Traditionally, \ac{HIDS} make use of application logfiles, which are parsed
for information on possible attacks and to identify malicious clients. The Introduction Prevention Systems (\ac{IPS}) Fail2ban\cite{fail2ban} is 
is an one of the most prim
\par
The goal of this thesis will be the design and implementation of a new \ac{IPC} architecture for the
transmission of log messages, that is able to facilitate low latency communication
between sender and receiver. Additionally, the design should be able to scale to multiple
recipients, in order to accommodate more complex security system, in which several processes
require access to a hosts application log. For this purpose, a Proof-of-Concept \ac{IPS} will be 
developed, that utilizes the proposed \ac{IPC} architecture to receive log messages and ban malicious
clients in the style of Fail2ban. 


This thesis will be structured as follows: The following section provides background 
information on relevant concepts,
