# Implementation
This directory contains all source files for the implementation, as well as 
scripts and configuration files used in the evaluation of the implementation.


# Directories
- `ebpf-helpers` contains binaries, for interacting with the eBPF program and related maps used by `simplefail2ban`
They are adapted versions of the programs found in `src/cmdline_prog`, in the repository for the master thesis of Florian Mikolajczak.
- `fail2ban-config` contains the jail and filter for `udp_server`, which were used in the evaluation of fail2ban.
- `lib` contains libraries used in the implementation, including the shared memory ring buffer.
- `programs` contains source files for the applications `udp_server`, `simplefail2ban` and `simplelogstash`.
- `scripts` contains scripts for traffic generation with TRex and experimental setup for the DUT
- `utilities` contains the source file for the `poll_rbuf` utility, that can be used to inspect the shared memory ring buffer.
Additionally, two benchmarks for the hashfunction and binary IP to string conversion are included.

The files developed for the bachelor thesis of Daniel von Rauchhaupt are `src/lib/include/sock_comm.h` and `src/lib/sock_comm.c`.
The applications `udp_server` and `simeplfail2ban` were also modified to support the new socket architecture.
